App Service provides various features such as security, load balancing, autoscaling, and automated management, and offers DevOps capabilities such as continuous deployment from Azure DevOps, GitHub, Docker Hub, and other sources, package management, staging environments, custom domain, and TLS/SSL certificates[1](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/azure-docs/blob/main/articles/app-service/overview.md).

Then, you can use the Key Vault reference as the value of app settings or connection strings in your App Service or Azure Functions apps[1](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/azure-docs/blob/main/articles/app-service/app-service-key-vault-references.md). To do this, you can use the `@Microsoft.KeyVault` syntax to reference the secret in the Key Vault[1](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/azure-docs/blob/main/articles/app-service/app-service-key-vault-references.md). You can create the app setting with the Key Vault reference using the Azure CLI command `az webapp config appsettings set`[2](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/azure-docs/blob/main/articles/app-service/configure-encrypt-at-rest-using-cmk.md). After updating the app setting, the web app will restart and you can browse to it to ensure it has started correctly using the Key Vault reference[2](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/azure-docs/blob/main/articles/app-service/configure-encrypt-at-rest-using-cmk.md).\n"

This workflow builds a container with the latest app changes, pushes the container to ACR, and updates the web application staging slot to point to the latest container pushed[1](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/azure-docs/blob/main/articles/app-service/app-service-sql-github-actions.md). The workflow includes a build and deploy job, where the build job checks out source code, authenticates with ACR, builds a container image, and deploys it to ACR[1](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/azure-docs/blob/main/articles/app-service/app-service-sql-github-actions.md). The deployment job logs into Azure, gathers environment and Azure resource information, updates Web App Settings, and deploys to an App Service staging slot[1](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/azure-docs/blob/main/articles/app-service/app-service-sql-github-actions.md). To run the build, push, and deploy workflow, you need to open your `build-deploy.yaml` file in `.github/workflows` within your repository, verify that the environment variables for `AZURE_RESOURCE_GROUP` and `WEB_APP_NAME` match the ones in `azuredeploy.yaml`, and update the `ACR_LOGIN_SERVER` value for your ACR login server[1](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/azure-docs/blob/main/articles/app-service/app-service-sql-github-actions.md).\n"

       "To deploy a container from Azure Container Registry (ACR) to a web app, you can use the build, push, and deploy workflow provided by GitHub Actions[1](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/azure-docs/blob/main/articles/app-service/app-service-sql-github-actions.md). This workflow builds a container with the latest app changes, pushes the container to ACR, and updates the web application staging slot to point to the latest container pushed[1](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/azure-docs/blob/main/articles/app-service/app-service-sql-github-actions.md). The workflow includes a build and deploy job, where the build job checks out source code, authenticates with ACR, builds a container image, and deploys it to ACR[1](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/azure-docs/blob/main/articles/app-service/app-service-sql-github-actions.md). The deployment job logs into Azure, gathers environment and Azure resource information, updates Web App Settings, and deploys to an App Service staging slot[1](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/azure-docs/blob/main/articles/app-service/app-service-sql-github-actions.md). To run the build, push, and deploy workflow, you need to open your `build-deploy.yaml` file in `.github/workflows` within your repository, verify that the environment variables for `AZURE_RESOURCE_GROUP` and `WEB_APP_NAME` match the ones in `azuredeploy.yaml`, and update the `ACR_LOGIN_SERVER` value for your ACR login server[1](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/azure-docs/blob/main/articles/app-service/app-service-sql-github-actions.md)."
